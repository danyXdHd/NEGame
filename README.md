# General Despcription
This is a personal project that I have started, it is as the name sugest a game made without a game engine.   
The main programing language is C++, but I am also using a bit oj JSON to store some data.  
My objective is to make a good game all by myself.  
Most likely the game will only run on Windows, but in the future maybe it will be ported on other operating systems.  


# The libraries that I am usig:
* SFML - This is the library that I use to create, manage and rander things to the Window.
* (Other Libraries incoming)
